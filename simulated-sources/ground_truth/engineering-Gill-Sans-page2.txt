Westinghouse and from Eiffel to Edison, has been epoch-making.
For when James Watt, clock-repairer, tinker, being called into a certain small laboratory in
England more than a century ago to make a few minor repairs on a new design of steam-engine,
discovered, while at work on this crude unit deriving its motion from expanded steam and the
alternate workings of a lever actuated by a weight, the value of superheated steam for power
purposes, and later embodied the idea in a steam-engine of his own, Watt set the civilized world
forward into an era so full of promise and discovery that even we who are living to-day, despite
the wonderful progress already made in mechanics as represented among other things in the
high-speed engine, the dynamo, the airplane, are witnessing but the barest of beginnings.
Likewise, when George Westinghouse, inventor of the airbrake, having finally persuaded the
directors of the Pennsylvania Railroad, after many futile attempts in other directions, to grant
him an opportunity to try out his invention, and, trying it out—on a string of cars near
Harrisburg—ably demonstrated its practicability as a device for stopping trains and preventing
accidents, he also—as had Watt before him—set the civilized world forward into an era full of
promise and discovery as yet but barely entered upon, even with the remarkable progress
already made in industry alone in the matter of regard for the safety of human life—
Westinghouse’s own particular blazed trail through the forest of human ignorance this same
airbrake.
So with other pioneers—with Eiffel, in the field of tower construction; with Edison, in the field
of electricity; with the Wright brothers, in the field of aerial navigation; With Simon Lake,
inventor of the submarine boat. All were pioneers; all set the civilized world forward; all—
though this perhaps is irrelevant, yet it will serve to reveal the type of men these pioneers were
and are—all overcame great obstacles—Lake not the least among them.
Told that he was visionary, when Lake explained, as he did in his effort to enlist capital with
which to build his first submarine boat, that he could safely submerge his invention and steer it
about on the bed of the ocean as readily as a man can steer an automobile about the streets of a
city, that while submerged he could step out of the boat through a trap-door without flooding
the boat, by the simple process of maintaining a greater air pressure inside than the pressure of
the water outside—Simon Lake, discouraged on every hand, finally decided to build a boat
himself, and did build one, with his own hands—a boat fourteen feet long and constructed of
rough pine timbers painted with coal-tar—in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. With this boat
Lake demonstrated to a skeptical world for all time that he was neither a visionary nor a
dreamer, but a practical doer among men—an engineer.
Of such stuff, then, were, and are, engineers made. Whether they realized it or not, whether
the world at large realized it or not, each represented a noble calling, each was a professional
man, each was chiseling his name for all time into the granite foundations of a wonderful
profession even yet only in the building—engineering. Their name is legion, too, and their names
will last because of the fact that their work, remaining as it does after them equally with the
work of
